# SQL Basics: Create a FUNCTION (DATES)


## Instructions

For this challenge you need to create a basic Age Calculator function which 
calculates the age in years on the age field of the peoples table.

The function should be called `agecalculator`, it needs to take 1 date and 
calculate the age in years according to the date NOW and must return an 
integer.

You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain 
the function on your final submit.


### Database Schema

```
people table schema
- id
- name
- age
```


### Note

Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the 
actual testing.
